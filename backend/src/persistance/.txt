I'm experimenting with dependency injection as I saw a video on it
My database layer thing is a dependency to inject

what if I made this persistance folder it's own npm folder with it's own packages
or it contains folders for planetscale-persistance, mongo-persistance etc. 
Then to inject the dependency I import 'persistor' from './persistance/planetscale/persister.ts'
That way the other dependencies such as @planetscale/database can live in that folder only,
and not get used if that's not the dependency injected...
of course then you would have to detect which one it is when you run npm i in the top level
I wonder if there is a system for this. I can think of npm private packages
I wonder if that is too cumbersome to do easily (not easily as my idea of folders with their own dependencies)
if programming language/framework designers can make this kind of segmentation easier / naturaler, than people will naturally end up with packages that can be shared with others
Of course there is the sad truth of needing maintenance
but even regardless of publishing it could be a good idea in regards to seperation of concerns. 
Like in python there is submodules that is what I'm thinking of

Anyway if ur reading this and you have thoughts/knowledge you can let me know in the github issues or at my email:- `contact` + `@` + `ttools.io` (you don't know where the spam bots are crawling i assume).
