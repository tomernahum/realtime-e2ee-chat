I'm experimenting with dependency injection as I saw a video on it
My database layer thing is a dependency to inject

what if I made this persistance folder it's own npm folder with it's own packages
or it contains folders for planetscale-persistance, mongo-persistance etc. 
Then to inject the dependency I import 'persistor' from './persistance/planetscale/persister.ts'
That way the other dependencies such as @planetscale/database can live in that folder only,
and not get used if that's not the dependency injected...
of course then you would have to detect which one it is when you run npm i in the top level
I wonder if there is a system for this. I can think of npm private packages
I wonder if that is too cumbersome to do easily (not easily as my idea of folders with their own dependencies)
