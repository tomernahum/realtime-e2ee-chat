Todo CURRENT:

if you're reading this feel free to contribute one of these as a PR
(sorry the code was bad I'm totally way better now)


- I really thought I implemented message padding in the encryption but I can't find it? need to make sure it's there

- persist identity/chat color across reloads, maybe have button in chat that shows identity that you can expand to select color or refresh identity
- typing in box should expand

- Improve Sidebar - drop shadow and click out of it to close it!
- Recent rooms in sidebar
- QR code in room generation popup
- SEO tags
    I deserve first or second result for "free chatrooms no login e2ee"

- maybe make text smaller or something
- fix up FAQ

~~FAQ, revise about page~~






OLD:

Realtime is global but rooms is local to component

I think it would be good to still listen for messages on all rooms if you change tab




Todo Next:
- Color contrast / (seeing your own color)

- disappearing rooms, (named rooms?)
- pagination
- Improve typing in box. So it expands.
- Favicon
- Room Names

- Many other features see kanban
    - replies
    - favicon changing

- (Styling?)
- Restructure website page structure w/ homepage for landing on etc
    - plus basic SEO optimization / meta tags


Done
- Word wrap
- Canonize Restructuring / Organize folders I think done
