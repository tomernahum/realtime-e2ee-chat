Todo:
- new messages centering when sidebar on



Todo: 
- ! Test what happens if database goes down and make it resilient
- Load test the server, maybe with a local database copy
- Add date sent to the server maybe? or some clear way of ordering it besides by database id. although that is good enough probably
- Create a system to remove messages older than blank and not in 500 most recent messages

- Pad encrypted messages
- Remember your userId accross reloads (easy)

- recent chats (in chat page and maybe in sidebar)
    - implement chatroom names (maybe)

- See https://realtime.ttools.io/chat/room/ee7c3eaf#QHLpsxHrjGYmNeRYiTzf2A 
    - many improvements, primarily frontend
- 
- 

- Notifications 

- Move to standalone website, maybe redo the frontend
- listening even if you are on a different page maybe?


Done
- end 2 end typesaftey? 
- chatrooms
- Encryption
- Persist chatrooms (to planetscale) - (mostly done)

In future app:
- optional accounts 
    - share to accounts
    - save workspaces
- rate limiting

- shared state w/ edits (maybe with y.js, maybe something else higher level)


Unrelated todo:
    - learn about env variables!

Refactoring todo:
    - may not make sense for page/Room to create encryption object and pass it to the chat component, why not just pass the key to the chat component
        - difference right now is the decryption error message is displayed at the page level rather than the chat level.
